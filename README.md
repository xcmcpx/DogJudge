THIS APPLICATION IS THE FIRST FULL-STACK APPLICATION I HAVE BUILT. IT IMPLEMENTS FRONT-END, BACK-END, AND MIDDLEWARE CODING USING MEAN STANDARDS,
AND IT IS THE CAPSTONE APPLICATION FOR AN ONLINE BOOTCAMP I FOLLOWED. IT WAS DURING MY TIME BUILDING THIS APP THAT I LEARNED THINGS SUCH AS CRUD
OPERATIONS, RESTFUL ROUTING, MIDDELWARES FOR AUTHENTICATION, FORM VALIDATION, AND MANY OTHER CONCEPTS USED IN MODERN WEB DEVELOPMENT.
IT IS CONNECTED TO MONGODB, AND USERS CAN FULLY LOG IN/SIGN UP USING THE DATABASE. USER INFORMATION IS PROTECTED VIA ENCRYPTION AND SALTING.
I HOPE IT IS A SOLID REPRESENTATION FOR MY WORK.
